# Simple project that should demonstrate how Qt Android Services (Qt5.7) works #


## Receiver
for boot time starting

## What have I done ##
* Created a custom activity (MyCustomAppActivity.java)
* Created a custom service (MyCustomAppService.java)
* Changed AndroidManifest.xml so that the custom activity/service gets used
* Changed AndroidManifest.xml and enabled background_running for service
* used "android.app.arguments" in AndroidManifest.xml to distuingish between Service and Application
